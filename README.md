# Next GraphQL Blog

A Blog including a server and a client.
Server is built with Node, Express & a customized GraphQL-yoga server.
Client is built with React, Next js & Apollo client.

The idea behind this app was that I wanted to learn all basic and advanced concepts when it comes to GraphQL together with Next js/React. This resulted in a great app that can fit very well as a boilerplate and as a inpiration source for upcoming projects.
